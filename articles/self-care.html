            <li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> Don’t hesitate to reach out to a therapist or counselor if you need support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Social Self-Care</h2>
        <p>Maintaining social connections is crucial for mental health. Consider the following:</p>

            <li><strong>Volunteer:</strong> Helping others can boost your mood and create a sense of community.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Setting Boundaries</h2>
        <p>Learning to say no and setting limits is essential for self-care. Here are some tips:</p>

        <p>
            Self-care is not a one-size-fits-all approach. It requires understanding your own needs and finding practices that work best for you.
