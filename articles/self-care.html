            <h3>What is Self-Care?</h3>
            <p>
                Self-care refers to the practices and habits that individuals use to take care of their physical, emotional, and mental health. 
                It is essential for maintaining balance, reducing stress, and improving overall well-being.
            </p>

            <h3>Why is Self-Care Important?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves mental clarity and focus.</li>
                <li>Reduces stress and anxiety levels.</li>
                <li>Enhances emotional resilience.</li>
                <li>Promotes physical health and energy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practical Self-Care Tips</h3>
            <h4>1. Establish a Daily Routine</h4>
            <p>
                Create a balanced routine that includes time for work, relaxation, and hobbies. Setting consistent sleep and meal times can 
                significantly impact your mental health.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Practice Mindfulness</h4>
            <p>
                Engage in mindfulness activities such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga. These practices help you stay present and reduce 
                feelings of stress.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Stay Physically Active</h4>
            <p>
                Exercise regularly to release endorphins, the "feel-good" hormones. Even a short daily walk can make a big difference.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Connect with Loved Ones</h4>
            <p>
                Social connections are vital for emotional support. Spend quality time with family and friends or join a supportive community.
            </p>

            <h4>5. Limit Screen Time</h4>
            <p>
                Reduce the time spent on social media and screens, especially before bedtime. Use this time to engage in offline activities like 
                reading or journaling.
            </p>
